Project Title: Movie Genre Classification Using Machine Learning.

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify movie genres based on their descriptions. The project utilizes three datasets: training data, test data, and a test data solution, all of which include columns for movie ID, title, genre, and description. The main goal is to predict the genre of movies in the test set using the descriptions provided.

Objectives:
Preprocess the text data to ensure that the data is clean and in a format suitable for model training.
Train a machine learning model that can accurately predict movie genres based on descriptions.
Evaluate the model's performance to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Analyze the model's predictions to identify areas for improvement and refine the model as necessary.

Datasets:
Training Data: Contains movie IDs, titles, genres, and descriptions. This data is used to train the machine learning model.

Test Data: Contains movie IDs, titles, and descriptions without genres. This data is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Test Data Solution: Contains movie IDs, titles, genres, and descriptions for the test data, allowing for comparison against the model's predictions.
